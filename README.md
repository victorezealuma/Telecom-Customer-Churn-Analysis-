## Background

The objective of this data analysis portfolio project explores factors behind customer churn, seeking to uncover patterns, trends and predictive indicators. CSV data was transformed into SQL tables, enabling meaningful insights to address real-world business concerns. Utilizing Power BI for visualization, a comprehensive understanding of attrition was gained, facilitating effective business strategy for customers retention. 

## Customer Database 
This is a comprehensive customer churn dataset, containing a single data table with over 1000 records of valuable customer data. 



## Data Analysis 
1. The dataset was downloaded from an external website in a csv file format. 
2. Imported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet where data cleaning and transformation was carried out. This include removing duplicates, null values and inconsistency in the data.
3. The data was further moved into a Microsoft SQL server database for querying.
4. Power BI was used as a preferred visualization tool to perform further calculations in power query editor such as percentage(%) of customers churned using aggregate functions before visualisation was finally built.
